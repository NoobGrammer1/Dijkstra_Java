## Executing the program

Since this program was created in the scope of 6 nodes as maximum, you have to introduce a graph having that amount of nodes.
"How many nodes do you want in your graph? [4-6]"
[Introduce any number in 4 and 6 range]
"Insert edges and their values for 1 as this => 2-5,3-6,5-1 || 4-4 || 4,2 || 4,1"
[You may have to introduce the neighbors of 1, as this nodeDest1-CostToThatNode,nodeDest2-CostToThatNode,..]
..
..
..
"Insert the starting node:"
[Any node]
"Insert the ending node:"
[Any other node]
.. result.
## Missings

Sometimes you may get some erros that I have been noticed, even though you may get an answer.
Also you should implement a method to control the inputs.
